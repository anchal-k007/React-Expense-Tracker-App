# React-Expense-Tracker-App
This is a React App that is used to track the expenses made by a person. 
It has 3 major components
  1. The add new expense component that is used to add a new expense to the list
  2. The chart component that represents the distribution of expenses in a calendar year
  3. The expense list component that has a filter from which we can select the year to filter the expenses. It displays the list of expenses made in that calendar year. Newest expenses made are shown first.

The App is referenced from this Udemy course. It is the first project created in sections 3-7
